My name is  **`Julián Ortega García`**,  I am a Systems Engineer and I am passionate about the field of **`Cybersecurity`**.

One of my many objectives is to be able to work as **`pentester`**, Therefore, I have decided to keep myself constantly trained, acquiring new knowledge and at the same time putting it into practice in controlled environments on platforms such as [Hackthebox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) y [Tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/), in addition to preparing myself for well-known certifications in the industry.

I am passionate about cybersecurity and data protection. Since discovering my interest in computer science, I have devoted much of my time to learning and experimenting with different pentesting and ethical hacking tools and techniques.

I have used a variety of pentesting and ethical hacking tools, such as Nmap, Metasploit, Wireshark, and Burp Suite, among others. In addition, I have worked on designing and developing customized security systems to meet the specific needs of each client.

I am a proponent of ethical hacking and firmly believe in the importance of performing penetration testing to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in computer systems. I also make sure to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and techniques in cybersecurity by regularly participating in relevant courses and events.

I am always interested in learning and growing in my cybersecurity career, and I am looking for new opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge in the field of pentesting and ethical hacking.
